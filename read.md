## Morr | Backend Engineer Intern Assignment
### Overview
Write the code in Python, along with appropriate unit and integration tests. Please especially emphasize coding principles (code modularity, separation of concerns and testability).
Please don’t use Django rest framework for this assignment. You can use Flask, FastAPI or Django for this assignment.
Writing unit testing cases is mandatory and without unit test cases we won’t check the assignment.
This challenge is expected to take about 48 hours.
